# HacktheNorth - HangBot
A hangman game made with pygame and python.
Made by Mansoor, Faris, Kevin, and Ben.

The game is simple, guess letters using your keyboard to try and figure out what the word on the screen is. The number of letters in the word are denoted through the number of blanks on the screen. The themes revolve around space, technology, and science, so use them to your advantage to guess what the word is. Be careful though, there’s a limit to how many wrong answers you can have! Every wrong answer adds up to the HangBot being built. Once it’s fully built, game over! But, if you do guess the word, the game continues and your score increases. Try to get 10 in a row to win the game!
